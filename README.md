JumpToFolder is a utility that makes use of Everything to jump to a different folder in file managers and file dialogs. All without browsing the intermediate paths.
(If you are not familiar with Everything: it's a very, *very* fast search tool for your files and folders on local as well as network disks with too many useful features to describe here. It is also free. (https://voidtools.com)
<br>
<br>
So if your file manager is currently in folder c:\a\b\c\d\e\this and you want to go to x:\f\g\h\i\that, start JumpToFolder, type that in the appearing Everything window and select x:\f\g\h\i\that from the list. The file manager will change to that folder without further effort.

Or another example: you want to update the MP3 tags of an album, but can't remember where you put it or what it was called. All you can remember is that it has 'thunderstruck' on it. With JumpToFolder you can do the following:

* Right-click in an empty part of the list of files in File Explorer,
* Select JumpToFolder,
* Everything will open; type part of a foldername or file in the resultlist,
* Double-click or press ENTER on the file/folder of your choice.
* Done!

The file dialog /filemanager will automatically jump to the folder you selected:
